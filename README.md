# decisionForest
Connected Component Labeling: Python script used to generate forest of decision trees.
The generated algorithms can be performed in 2D or in 3D. 

This python file creates C++ headers and sources files.

Given a connectivity, it will generate multiple headers and one source file.
The source file contains the function that perform the connected component labeling.
